Observations from the experiment:

- Fraud cases form a very small percentage of total transactions.
- The model can achieve high accuracy even while missing fraud cases.
- Evaluation metrics such as recall and precision are more appropriate than accuracy.
- Handling imbalanced data is essential in real-world detection systems.
